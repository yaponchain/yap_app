                                Please read this Interface Agreement (this "Agreement") carefully. This Agreement is a legally binding agreement between you ("you", "your" or "User") and Yap On Chain ("Yap On Chain" or "we" or "us"). By clicking or tapping any button or box marked "I Accept," "I Agree," or "OK" (or a similar term) in connection with this Agreement, or by using the Site or App to access the Protocol (each as defined below), you acknowledge and agree to this Agreement and confirm that you are of legal age where you live and have the legal capacity to enter into this Agreement.
                                <br><br>
                                This Agreement is between you and Yap On Chain concerning your use of the website located at yaponchain.xyz (the “Site”) and corresponding application (the “App”) offered by us. To make this Agreement easier to read, the Site, App, and our services are collectively called the “Interface.” The Interface provides a graphical, browser-based, and easily comprehensible means for users to view blockchain transactions and interact with smart contracts of the Yap On Chain ecosystem (the “Protocol”). The Protocol is autonomous “smart contract” software executed in a distributed manner by blockchain validators enabling its users to participate in decentralized finance and gaming mechanisms. We do not own or control the Protocol. We do not take ownership or control of your assets when you use our Interface to interact with the Protocol. You do not need to use the Interface to interact with the Protocol. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NEITHER YAP ON CHAIN NOR THE INTERFACE IS A LENDER, BORROWER, OR PARTY TO ANY TRANSACTION YOU MAY ENTER INTO USING THE PROTOCOL.
                                <br><br>
                                If you are an individual accessing or using the Interface on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation, partnership, or other entity with which you are associated (an "Organization"), then you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of yourself and such Organization, and you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind such Organization to this Agreement. References to "you" and "User" in this Agreement will refer to both the individual using the Interface and to any such Organization.
                                <br><br>
                                NOTICE ON PROHIBITED USE – RESTRICTED PERSONS: THE INTERFACE AND ANY RELATED SERVICES ARE NOT OFFERED TO AND MAY NOT BE USED BY PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO RESIDE IN, ARE CITIZENS OF, ARE LOCATED IN, ARE INCORPORATED IN, OR HAVE A REGISTERED OFFICE IN ANY RESTRICTED TERRITORY. “Restricted Territory” means any country or region subject to international sanctions or embargoes, including but not limited to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk People’s Republic, and Luhansk People’s Republic regions of Ukraine. USE OF A VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK (“VPN”) OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR MEANS INTENDED TO CIRCUMVENT THESE RESTRICTIONS IS PROHIBITED.
                                <br><br>
                                This Agreement contains a mandatory arbitration provision requiring the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions.
                                <br><br>
                                1. Changes.
